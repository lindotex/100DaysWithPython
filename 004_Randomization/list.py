# Lists, Offsets and appending:

# List of States:
## Important
states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Pensilvania", "New Jersey", "Georgia", "Connecticut"]

print(states_of_america[1]) # This will return the value: "Pensilvania."

# OFFSET:
# A List doesn't start at the position 1... it starts at 0!
# And all the following itens of a list, is counted after its orign...
# in this sense, the second item of a list, has an offset (from the orign) of 1.
# the fouth item, has an offset of 3. and so on...
