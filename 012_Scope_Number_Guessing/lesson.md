# Scope:
    Understanding the theory behind scope and its use.

    ## Global Scope:
        Global scope means a variable that has been set up at the root of its archive.
        it means that they can be used in every scope inside of it. Being used as reference in functions, loops and wherever they are needed.
        For that reason, most variables or properties that is defined as global, are normally treated as constants.
    
    ## Local Scope:
        Different from Global Scope, local scope means that this property/variable will not work outside of its scope of definition. In other words, a variable that has been defined inside of a function, cannot be treated outside of the scope of its function.
